## Overview
The Humanity Financial Trust Project aims to create a secure, fair, and stable financial platform for the community and the world. It integrates game development, operating system development, and web technologies, using both advanced programming techniques and user-centric design principles to ensure accessibility and effectiveness for all.

This project combines:
- Operating system kernel development (AX86 Assembly, C, C++)
- Game development with a focus on user engagement (C++, Python)
- Web frontend and backend systems (JavaScript, Node.js, HTML/CSS)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) design (C++ with OpenGL)
- Financial tools for managing resources (Python, SQL)

## Technologies Used
- **Assembly (AX86)**: Bootloader initialization and low-level system control
- **C**: Operating system kernel development (cross-platform)
- **C++**: Game engine development, graphical user interface (GUI) system, and high-performance processing
- **Python**: Automation scripts, backend tools, and game logic implementation
- **Node.js**: Backend API servers for data processing and communication
- **JavaScript**: Web frontend for user interface and interactive components
- **OpenGL**: Graphics rendering and visualization
- **SQL**: Database management for financial data storage and query optimization
