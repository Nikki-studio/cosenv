Worker 1: Joseph Wangai Mwaniki.

Wangai says:
"""
Hello, World!
I, Joseph Wangai Mwaniki, had a dream of a system that would help all and sundry.
As stated before, this project has been dedicated to Christ, and I wish it to be done for His glory.
Even if I do not complete it myself, my God shall appoint another of my brothers in Christ to continue.
This tool is meant to share the gospel, crush monopoly, and stop oppression.

Glory be to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

And â€” read your Bible.
